(* Examples

   Examples (with tested outputs to give some extra proof against regressions)
   of functions built using Arrows. Basic functions like a simple conceptual
   branching adder show simple usage of Arrows with the built in support for
   arrow inference of basic types 'a -> 'b (where 'b must support equality).

   More complex examples such as the usage of circuits show the ability to
   make custom types instances of Arrow and use them appropriately. *)

(* Adder

   The simple stateless adding Arrow given as part of the examples at
   https://www.haskell.org/arrows/syntax.html

   We are forced to give some type annotations to help the type inference
   along, helping to infer the type of >>> in this case. We could equally
   specify the types of f or g with the same result. *)

let addA f g : int -> int =
    f &&& g >>> (fun (y, z) -> y + z)

[<Fact>]
let ``addA behaves correctly`` () =
    Arrow.run (addA ((*) 2) ((/) 3)) 3 =! 7

(* Circuits

   Circuits shows a more advanced application of Arrows, defining a new type
   and the implementation of it to inhabit Arrow. This circuit example is
   taken from the Haskell Wiki Arrow Tutorial
   (https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Arrow_tutorial) although only the
   implentation down to mean is shown here - it's a good introduction to arrows
   and circuits without bringing in too much baggage. *)
